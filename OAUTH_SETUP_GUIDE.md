# OAuth Setup Guide for Atlassian MCP VS Code Extension

## Overview

The Atlassian MCP VS Code extension now includes a fully functional OAuth setup wizard that helps you authenticate with Atlassian Cloud services. This guide explains how to use the OAuth setup functionality.

## How to Access OAuth Setup

There are several ways to access the OAuth setup wizard:

### Method 1: Via Extension Configuration
1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "Atlassian MCP: Configure" and select it
3. Click the "ðŸš€ OAuth Setup Wizard" button in the configuration panel

### Method 2: Via Command Palette
1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "Atlassian MCP: OAuth Setup Wizard" and select it

### Method 3: Via Extension Panel
1. Open the Explorer panel in VS Code
2. Find the "Atlassian MCP" section
3. Click "OAuth Setup Wizard" in the welcome view

## OAuth Setup Process

When you run the OAuth setup wizard, you'll be presented with two options:

### Web-based Setup (Recommended)
This is the preferred method as it runs entirely within VS Code:

1. **Choose "Web-based setup (Recommended)"**
2. **Enter OAuth Credentials:**
   - Client ID: Your Atlassian OAuth app client ID
   - Client Secret: Your Atlassian OAuth app client secret
   - Scopes: Default scopes are provided (you can modify if needed)

3. **Browser Authorization:**
   - A local callback server starts on `localhost:8080`
   - Your default browser opens to the Atlassian authorization page
   - Log in and authorize the application

4. **Automatic Configuration:**
   - The extension automatically exchanges the authorization code for tokens
   - Auto-detects your Atlassian Cloud ID
   - Displays all configuration variables you need

### Terminal-based Setup (Fallback)
This method uses the bundled server CLI tool:

1. **Choose "Terminal-based setup"**
2. **Interactive Terminal:**
   - A VS Code terminal opens with the OAuth setup wizard
   - Follow the prompts to enter your OAuth credentials
   - Complete the browser authorization flow

## Setting Up Your Atlassian OAuth App

Before using the OAuth setup wizard, you need to create an OAuth app in the Atlassian Developer Console:

1. **Go to [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)**
2. **Create a new app:**
   - Click "Create" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 integration"
   - Give your app a name (e.g., "VS Code MCP Integration")

3. **Configure your app:**
   - **Callback URL:** `http://localhost:8080/callback`
   - **Scopes:** Select the following scopes:
     - `read:jira-work` - Read Jira issues
     - `write:jira-work` - Create/update Jira issues  
     - `read:confluence-content.all` - Read Confluence content
     - `write:confluence-content` - Create/update Confluence content
     - `offline_access` - Refresh tokens

4. **Get your credentials:**
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
   - These will be used in the OAuth setup wizard

## After OAuth Setup

Once the OAuth setup is complete, you'll see output like this:

```
ðŸŽ‰ OAuth setup completed successfully!

Add these environment variables to your .env file:
ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_CLOUD_ID=your-cloud-id
ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token

Your Atlassian URLs for configuration:
JIRA_URL=https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/your-cloud-id
CONFLUENCE_URL=https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/your-cloud-id/wiki
```

## VS Code Settings

You can also configure the extension through VS Code settings:

1. Open Settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac, `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "Atlassian MCP"
3. Configure:
   - Jira URL
   - Confluence URL
   - Authentication method (set to "oauth")
   - Auto-start server option

## Troubleshooting

### Port 8080 in Use
If you get an error that port 8080 is in use:
- Close other applications using that port
- Or use the terminal-based setup method

### Browser Doesn't Open
If the browser doesn't open automatically:
- Check the VS Code output panel for the authorization URL
- Manually copy and paste the URL into your browser

### OAuth Errors
If you encounter OAuth errors:
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Ensure your OAuth app has the correct callback URL
- Check that all required scopes are granted

### Extension Not Working
If the extension setup doesn't work:
- Check the VS Code output panel for detailed error messages
- Try reloading VS Code (`Cmd+R` on Mac, `Ctrl+R` on Windows/Linux)
- Ensure you have the latest version of the extension

## Security Notes

- OAuth tokens are sensitive - keep them secure
- Don't commit OAuth credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or VS Code's secure storage
- Tokens can be revoked in your Atlassian account if needed

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the VS Code output panel (View â†’ Output â†’ "Atlassian MCP Server")
2. Enable verbose logging in extension settings
3. File an issue on the project GitHub repository with logs
